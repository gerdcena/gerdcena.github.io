        <b>The issue with Guards Hangout. [UPDATE]</b><br><br>
Basically, if you don't know, Guards Hangout is a Roblox group made by iphoneplayer10x.<br>
The owner of Guards Hangout has promoted their group without permission in our group shouts, and stole multiple graphics and models from us. I mean, the shirt he is wearing literally has a graphic I made on the back. (with alternated colors)
apparently you become a 'Gerd's Group member" if you join his group?<br>
He also had the audacity to steal our old group description.<br>
But this doesn't end here, when faced with his allegations, they responded with "Go cry about it".<br>
So basically I just want to spread awareness about Guards Hangout. To support us, please cut ties with them if you have any.
DO NOT ALLOW PEOPLE TO STEAL YOUR CONTENT!<br>
Sincerely,<br>
-Gerd<br>
[update] he stole this statement and put it on his group too lol<br>

        Hello everyone! Welcome to my first site. To make this, I watched some html and CSS tutorials. This website is pretty barebones for now, but it may become more in the future, especially after I learn JavaScript lol.
